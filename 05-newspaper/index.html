              I don&rsquo;t have many fond memo&shy;ries of school cafe&shy;te&shy;ria lun&shy;ches.
              There are two main rea&shy;sons for that. One, my mom packed my lunch most of the
              time, and two, when I did par&shy;take in what was on the menu, it was pret&shy;ty
              abys&shy;mal. There was one shin&shy;ing excep&shy;tion, however: the rolls.
            </p>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
              To this day, I can prac&shy;ti&shy;cally smell and taste those soft, fluf&shy;fy
              won&shy;ders. Sure, some peo&shy;ple may trea&shy;sure the memory of home&shy;made
              rolls lovingly baked by mothers or grand&shy;mo&shy;thers. My mom, however, has always
              been more of a cake baker than a bread baker, so the ele&shy;men&shy;tary school rolls
              have by default and affec&shy;tion lived on in my memo&shy;ries.
            </p>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
              That should help explain why when I say these <em>Pillowy Pull-Apart Dinner Rolls</em>
              remind me of what I had back then, it is the ulti&shy;mate com&shy;pli&shy;ment.
            </p>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
              The rolls bake beau&shy;ti&shy;fully into each other, which con&shy;tri&shy;butes both
              height and an attrac&shy;tive pull-apart appea&shy;rance. Even better, the dough comes
              toge&shy;ther quickly and easily in a stand mixer, with only one rela&shy;tively short
              rise after they&rsquo;ve been shaped.

              The rolls bake beau&shy;ti&shy;fully into each other, which con&shy;tri&shy;butes both
              height and an attrac&shy;tive pull-apart appear&shy;ance. Even better, the dough comes

            </p>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
              Using about 2 1/2 table&shy;spoons (48 grams) of dough for each roll, shape each
              por&shy;tion (lightly flour your palms bet&shy;ween each shap&shy;ing, if
              neces&shy;sary) into a smooth 1 3/4-inch ball. To encour&shy;age the best rise, try to
              form a &ldquo;glu&shy;ten cloak&rdquo; by pul&shy;ling the top of the dough down and
              around each ball before pinch&shy;ing and seal&shy;ing around the bot&shy;tom.
              Place the rolls on the pre&shy;pa&shy;red pan, spacing them about 3/4 inch apart in
              four rows of six. Cover with a clean kit&shy;chen towel and let rise for 45 minutes.
              The rolls will look puffy and will almost be touch&shy;ing, but most of the
              ris&shy;ing will take place during bak&shy;ing.
